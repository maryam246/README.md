# Python language Introduction:
Python is the general purpose dynamically typed high level language developed by Guido Van Rossum and released in 1991 at CWI Netherland.

# Python 3 basic: operators:
Pyton 3 supports a variety of operators including logical operators (And, or, Not) arithmetic operators(+,-,*,/) Comparison operators (>,<,==,!=).

Variables:Python 3 the variables are created by assigning a value to a name for example , x=5 created a variable called x and assigns the value 5 to it.

Data type: Python 3 support several built-in data types, including integers floats, string, booleans, lists, tuples and dictionaries.

Control Flow Statment: Python 3 contains several controls flow from statement including if-else statement, For Loops, and While loops. These statement allows you to control the flow of execution in your code.

Function: Python 3 Functions are created using the def keyboard . For example def my-function(x): creates a function called my-function that takes one argument called x.

#Python The new generation language: Python is the Fourth-generation programming language. In fouth-generation programming language, the coding language is quite similer to the language of human being.

#Important difference between python 2.x and python 3.x : Python was created back in 2000 Be-open python lab. The last version of python2.7 was created in 2010 and it end of support in 2020. Python3 was created in 2008. Python2 has more complicated syntax than python3. Python3 has an easier syntax compared to Python2. A lot of libraries of python2 are not forward compatible. A lot of libraries are created in python3 to be strickly used with python3. Differences: 1.Defult Text String. 2.Syntax Differences. 3.Division of Numbers. 4.libraries

#Namespaces and Scope in Python: A Namespaces is the system to have a unique name for each and every object in Python. An object might be a variableor a method. Python itselfmaintains a namespaces in the form of a python dictionary. Python interpreter understands what exacts method or variable one is trying to point to in the code, depending in the namespace. There are the three types of namespaces, 1.Local Namespaces. 2.Global Namespaces 3.Built-in Namespaces

#Statement, Indentation and Comment in Python: 1.statment in python , A python statment is the instruction that the python can be execute.There are the different type of statment in python language as assignment statements,Conditional statement,Looping statements. 2.Indentation in python, Python requires indentation to define statement blocks. A block of code must have a consistent number of spaces. To indent in Python, whitespaces are preferred over tabs. Also, use either whitespace or tabs to indent; mixing tabs and whitespaces in indentation can result in incorrect indentation errors. 3.comment in python, Comments in Python begin with a hash mark ( # ) and whitespace character and continue to the end of the line.
